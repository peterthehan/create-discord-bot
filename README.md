A module-based Discord bot template.

## Getting started

### Register a Discord bot application

1. Go to Discord's [Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications).
2. Create a new application.
3. Go to the Bot tab and add a bot user to your application.

   > Take note of the bot token on this page, you will need it in the next section.

   > Keep your token and any file containing it **private**. If it ever leaks or you suspect it may have leaked, simply `regenerate` a new token to invalidate your compromised token.

4. In the Bot tab, scroll down to the `Privileged Gateway Intents` section and enable the toggles for both `Presence Intent` and `Server Members Intent`. More information on `Gateway Intents` can be found here:

   - [Gateway Update FAQ](https://support-dev.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360056426994)
   - [Privileged Intents](https://discord.com/developers/docs/topics/gateway#privileged-intents)

### Create a Discord bot project

1. Run the following commands to bootstrap a Discord bot project in your working directory:

   > Replace `my-discord-bot` in the commands below with your own preferred project name!

   ```
   npx degit peterthehan/create-discord-bot my-discord-bot
   ```

   ```
   cd my-discord-bot
   ```

   ```
   npm i
   ```

2. Run the following command to rename the `.env` file:

   ```
   mv .env.example .env
   ```

3. Open the `.env` file and add your Discord bot token value.

4. Finally, run the following command to start the bot:

   ```
   npm start
   ```

   Verify the bot is running properly by sending messages in your server. The bot should log your messages in your terminal. If there are issues, check [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting) for tips.

You're ready to create your own Discord bot! ðŸŽ‰

If you were directed to follow the instructions found here from another `README`, return back there now and continue with the setup. Feel free to continue reading for more information.

## Bots

The following bots can be used by this template by adding them into the [/src/bots](./src/bots) folder:

- [discord-active-role-bot](https://github.com/peterthehan/discord-active-role-bot)
- [discord-audit-log-bot](https://github.com/peterthehan/discord-audit-log-bot)
- [discord-birthday-role-bot](https://github.com/peterthehan/discord-birthday-role-bot)
- [discord-cron-bot](https://github.com/peterthehan/discord-cron-bot)
- [discord-dad-bot](https://github.com/peterthehan/discord-dad-bot)
- [discord-dynamic-voice-channels-bot](https://github.com/peterthehan/discord-dynamic-voice-channels-bot)
- [discord-emoji-log-bot](https://github.com/peterthehan/discord-emoji-log-bot)
- [discord-reaction-role-bot](https://github.com/peterthehan/discord-reaction-role-bot)
- [discord-starboard-bot](https://github.com/peterthehan/discord-starboard-bot)
- [discord-superactive-role-bot](https://github.com/peterthehan/discord-superactive-role-bot)
- [discord-twitter-bot](https://github.com/peterthehan/discord-twitter-bot)

## Troubleshooting

- Remove bots in your server that may conflict in functionality, e.g. multiple reaction role bots.
- Use [Git Bash](https://git-scm.com/downloads) instead of the Command Prompt (cmd.exe) if you are on Windows.
- Check that your `npm` version is `>=7.0.0` by running `npm -v`.
- Check that your `node` version is `>=16.6.0` by running `node -v`.
- If running the application outputs `Error: Cannot find module '...'`, try running `npm i` in the project directory.
