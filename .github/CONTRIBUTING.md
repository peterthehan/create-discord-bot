## Project

### Folder structure

```
app/
  src/
    core/
    widgets/
      command/
    index.js

  index.js
```

Some files and directories are omitted for brevity.

### Component descriptions

The project is grouped into 3 components:

1. The **utility script** - the script that is being run with the `npx peterthehan/create-discord-bot` command.

   - `src/index.js`

2. The **core bot** - the framework that drives everything under `widgets/`.

   - `app/src/core/`
   - `app/src/index.js`

3. The **command widget** - the widget used to bootstrap command-making.

   - `app/src/widgets/command/`

</div>

### Scripts

#### GitHub Actions

- `npm run action:build` - checks that the typescript code compiles.
- `npm run action:check` - checks that the project complies with Prettier.
- `npm run action:lint` - checks that the project complies with ESLint.

These scripts are not intended to be used while developing.

#### Bot

- `npm run bot:dev` - runs the **core bot** using `nodemon`.
- `npm run bot:start` - runs the **core bot** using `node`.

#### Script

- `npm run dry` - runs the **utility script** but only prints the command line messages without actually creating a bot template.
- `npm start` - runs the **utility script** and creates a bot template.

#### Utility

- `npm run format` - first fixes ESLint issues and then runs Prettier across the entire project.
